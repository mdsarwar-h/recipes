            <!-- Description of the Mexican Casserole -->
        <p>
            This taco casserole with ground beef and tortilla chips is easy to make and very tasty. 
            I often substitute with ground turkey and low-fat dairy products, and it's still delicious! 
            Serve this casserole with chips, salsa, and green salad.
